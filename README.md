# Matrix Multiplication

When multiplying a matrix `A` of dimensions `(n, m)` with a matrix B of dimensions `(m, P)` , we obtain a matrix C of dimensions `(n, P)` :     A(n,m) * B(m,p) = C(n,p)
Matrix multiplication is performed by multiplying the components of the two matrices row by column.

Write a program that performs the multiplication of two matrices A and B taken from the user. The result of the multiplication will be stored in a third matrix C, which will then be displayed.
